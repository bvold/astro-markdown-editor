Initial prompt for claude.ai:
I would like a web application that I could host in a server in my network where I could bring markdown files into the (static?) site, and users could use a library/module/function to be able to edit the content and then save the markdown file back in GitHub.  Could you create this app step by step using the Astro framework and the Quill editor?  If there's a better choice of editor, I'm open to changing it, but I like Quill.  Also, if you need to add additional libraries or modules, that's totally fine too.

Next prompt for claude.ai:
In your last reply, you have a heading that says "Updated Editor Component", but it doesn't contain that - it instead contains a copy of the project setup steps.  Could you validate that you sent me the correct file and/or send me the updated editor component that uses the github.js component?
