Initial prompt for claude.ai:
I would like a web application that I could host in a server in my network where I could bring markdown files into the (static?) site, and users could use a library/module/function to be able to edit the content and then save the markdown file back in GitHub.  Could you create this app step by step using the Astro framework and the Quill editor?  If there's a better choice of editor, I'm open to changing it, but I like Quill.  Also, if you need to add additional libraries or modules, that's totally fine too.

Next prompt for claude.ai:
In your last reply, you have a heading that says "Updated Editor Component", but it doesn't contain that - it instead contains a copy of the project setup steps.  Could you validate that you sent me the correct file and/or send me the updated editor component that uses the github.js component?

Next prompt for claude.ai:

Now when I run, there is an error from Astro : 10:54:23 [ERROR] document is not defined
  Hint:
    Browser APIs are not available on the server.

    If the code is in a framework component, try to access these objects after rendering using lifecycle methods or use a client:only directive to make the component exclusively run on the client.

    See https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/troubleshooting/#document-or-window-is-not-defined for more information.

Next Prompt for claude.ai:

Now the Quill editor is displayed, but when I try to open a markdown file from a github repo, it gives an error in the JavaScript console: Error fetching file from GitHub: ReferenceError: Buffer is not defined
    at GitHubService.getFile (github.js:19:23)
    at async loadFile (Editor.jsx:32:32)

Next prompt for claude.ai:
The app works great now.   I'm wondering if you could add one more addition.  Can you please add a feature where you can point to a specific owner/repo/filename combo and the default it to show the file rendered as markdown, but have an edit button that toggles the Quill editor, then upon saving, after notifying the user that the save was successful or not, it would revert back to the rendered page again?

Next prompt for claude.ai:
When you hit "Cancel" and don't want to actually edit, can you make it so the file's rendered markdown shows up instead of just the title ?

Next prompt for claude.ai:

3 more updates - 1) Can you make it so the GitHub Personal Access Token is not stored in file but is rather stored in a place that wouldn't get checked in (I know that in NextJS for example, you can use .env.local to store variables).  2) Can you update the app so that in the case of either cancelling after going to edit or successfully saving that respectively either the old content gets displayed or the updated content gets displayed?  Right now, it allows you to cancel and also to edit and save, but the next page after that is just a title "Markdown Editor" and I would like it to be content, ideally.  3) Can you add a way to get back to the owner/repo/filename screen button?

Next prompt for claude.ai:

None of the 3 cases display content after 1. cancelling the edit  2. saving the file or 3. changing file with the new button.  Is there something that we might be missing?

Next prompt for claude.ai:

When I go into edit mode and then don't make any changes, the cancel button exits me out, but the original content is not displayed.  Here is the Astro component that implements this : // src/components/Editor.jsx

Next prompt for claude.ai:

That didn't fix it.  When I hit cancel, it displays the title "Markdown Editor" and then the rest of the page is blank.  However, in the JavaScript console there is this error : chunk-NUMECXU6.js?v=16bdd837:16670 Uncaught TypeError: quill.destroy is not a function
    at Editor.jsx:32:15

Next prompt for claude.ai:

There is one last issue.  I can now edit and save exactly one time, but if I try to again do an edit and then a save, the SHA doesn't match and it won't save.  Can you fix that, so after a save is done it either reads in the content from GitHub again to get the updated SHA code, or if it's possible, can you recalculate the SHA code so we don't need to re-read the contents?


Next prompt for claude.ai:

Now saving works, but after the save, when it goes back to the content (markdown) page, it's the old content.  After a save, the content should either be refetched from GitHub or if you're clever, maybe you have a way to update it locally.  Can you fix the content the appears after a save so that it is the new content?
